<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-an-ai-code-review-tool">What is an AI code review tool?</h3>
<p>An AI code review tool uses artificial intelligence, including machine learning and natural language processing, to automatically analyze source code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality violations. These tools can provide suggestions, generate fixes, summarize changes, and even create tests, augmenting or automating parts of the traditional human code review process.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-ai-code-review-tools-differ-from-traditional-static-analysis-tools">How do AI code review tools differ from traditional static analysis tools?</h3>
<p>While traditional static analysis tools follow predefined rules and patterns to identify issues, AI code review tools leverage machine learning models trained on vast codebases. This allows them to detect more complex, contextual, and often harder-to-find issues, learn from past fixes, and provide more intelligent, context-aware suggestions, sometimes even generating code or test cases.</p>
<h3 id="can-ai-code-review-tools-replace-human-code-reviewers">Can AI code review tools replace human code reviewers?</h3>
<p>Not entirely. AI code review tools are powerful assistants that can automate repetitive tasks, catch common errors, and provide initial feedback, significantly speeding up the review process. However, human reviewers remain crucial for understanding architectural implications, design decisions, business logic, and complex contextual nuances that AI currently struggles with. The goal is augmentation, not replacement.</p>
<h3 id="are-ai-code-review-tools-secure">Are AI code review tools secure?</h3>
<p>Reputable AI code review tools prioritize security and data privacy. They typically process code in secure environments and adhere to industry standards. However, it's essential to review the security policies and data handling practices of any tool you consider, especially if your code contains sensitive information or intellectual property. For on-premise or self-hosted solutions like SonarQube Community Edition, you retain more control over your data.</p>

<h3 id="what-programming-languages-do-ai-code-review-tools-support">What programming languages do AI code review tools support?</h3>
<p>Support varies significantly by tool. Some tools, like SonarQube and Codacy, offer broad support for 30-40+ languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Go, and more. Others, like Diffblue Cover, are highly specialized for a single language (Java). When evaluating tools, always check their specific language and framework compatibility to ensure it aligns with your tech stack.</p>
